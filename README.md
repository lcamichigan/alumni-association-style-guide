**501(c)(7)** Refers to a [part of section
501(c)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501(c)(7))
of the United States Internal Revenue Code that describes certain tax-exempt
nonprofit organizations. Donations to 501(c)(7) organizations are _not_
tax-deductible. Use _501(c)(7) organization_, not _501(c)(7)_, when describing
Sigma Alumni Association.

> Sigma Alumni Association is a 501(c)(7) organization.

_collegiate brother_ to an undergraduate, and _alumni brother_ to a graduate.
Use _members_ when referring to brothers and associate members generally.

**alma mater** Note lowercase. Plural is _almae matres_ or _almæ matres_.

association.

Spasyk ’49_. When writing for a broader audience, or if the alumnus is from a
different institution, include the institution name: _Murphy Osborne (High
Point ’58)_. Avoid abbreviating the year if your audience might find it
ambiguous; general audiences may read _Warren A. Cole (Boston ’12)_ as

In lists of members of the High Zeta, it’s customary to include the High Pi
after the High Epsilon. When communicating with alumni about the High Zeta,
prefer corporate titles to Greek titles. It’s OK to refer to the High Theta as
the Philanthropy Chairman.

Zeta. These additional officers are ranked after the High Epsilon according to
Code 3‑1(a). (Code 3‑9 provides for the election of additional officers, but not
necessarily to the High Zeta.)
